# Teanyth - NixOS Configuration

This is my personal NixOS configuration for my machines. You can find them under
the [hosts](hosts) folder.

You should really not be trying to install them, but you are free to take
inspiration from them. Some small parts are not included and are in a separate
private repository. This includes my secrets (although encrypted with
[sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix)) and some slightly sensitive data
not worth encrypting.

More information about the structure will likely come soon.
